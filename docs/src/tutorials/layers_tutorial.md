# **Tutorial 8:** Fun with Layers! An Intro to `@JLayer`

So far, we have been using `Javis` to create one animation at a time.
This has been great and you should be proud of your `Javis` skills so far!
However, what if I told you, there is a way to make multiple animations in one animation? ðŸ˜Ž

And the way to do that?
Layers - specifically, `@JLayer`'s!

## What Even Are Layers? And What's a `@Jlayer`?

_Explain what layers are.
Then move to explain what JLayer's are._

## Going Back to the Basics

In tutorial 1, you made the following animation:

For this tutorial, we are going to reuse this animation but create an artistic animation similar to the works of famous American pop artist, Andy Warhol - here is an example:

### Let's Add Some Color!

_In this section, take the dancing circles animation and turn into a function that allows a user to define its colors and positions of the planets - or something similar_

### Moving Our Animation with Layers

_Show here how to move around a layer (maybe through translation and rotation?)_

## Organizing Our Creation

### Positioning Our Layers

_Show where we are going to put layers and how they are organized in the four corners)_

### They're Multiplying!

_Create all four animations and move them to their appropriate locations.

## Conclusion

_Recap what was learned here._

## Full Code

_Add the full code snippet for the animation_
